## **Tech Stack for Your App**

### **Frontend:**

- **React.js**: For a dynamic and responsive UI.
- **React Router DOM**: For navigation between pages (login, quizzes, etc.).
- **Tailwind CSS**: For sleek and customizable designs.

### **Backend:**

- **Node.js + Express.js**: To handle user authentication, API requests, and reminders.
- **MongoDB**: For storing user data (points, progress, reminders).
- **Nodemailer**: For email-based reminders (can also be used with schedulers).
- **Socket.io** (optional): For real-time notifications (future scalability).

### **Other Tools:**

- **Google Maps API**: To locate the nearest recycling bin.
- **Cron Jobs (node-cron)**: For setting up reminder schedules.

### **Authentication:**

- **JWT**: To manage user sessions.
- **Bcrypt**: For secure password storage.

## **Detailed Guidance for Features**

### **1. Getting the Nearest Recycling Bin Address**

#### **Tech Stack:**

- **Frontend**: React (integrate Google Maps API).
- **Backend**: Use MongoDB to store bin locations (latitude, longitude).

#### **Steps:**

1. Use Google Maps API to render a map on the frontend.
2. Add a feature where the user can input their current location or use geolocation.
3. Backend API to fetch the nearest bins based on the user's coordinates:
   - Use MongoDB's **geospatial queries** (`$near` operator).

#### **Example:**

Apps like **Zomato** or **Google Maps** show nearby restaurants; you can replicate the same for recycling bins.

### **2. Quizzes to Test Knowledge of Waste Management**

#### **Tech Stack:**

- **Frontend**: React (manage quiz state).
- **Backend**: MongoDB (store quiz questions and user scores).

#### **Steps:**

1. Design a quiz component in React with multiple-choice questions.
2. Use dynamic rendering to fetch quiz data from an API.
3. Store the user's scores in MongoDB with their unique ID.
4. Add gamification, like badges or leaderboards (optional).

#### **Example:**

Websites like **Kahoot** or **Duolingo** use quizzes with gamified interfaces.

### **3. Learning Through Interactive Content**

#### **Tech Stack:**

- **Frontend**: React (dynamic content rendering).
- **Backend**: MongoDB (optional, to store progress).

#### **Steps:**

1. **Start with resource links:**

   - Provide categorized links to resources (e.g., government websites, YouTube videos).
   - Add brief summaries or sorted sections for faster learning.

2. **Make it interactive:**

   - Include **drag-and-drop sorting games**: Users drag items into the correct waste category.
   - Add **image-based quizzes**: Show an image (e.g., a plastic bottle), and the user selects the waste category.

3. **Progress Tracking:**
   - Show progress graphs or percentages using libraries like **Chart.js** or **D3.js**.
   - Save the progress (e.g., completed topics) in MongoDB.

#### **Examples of Interactive Learning:**

- **Khan Academy**: Combines videos with progress tracking and quizzes.
- **CodeCombat**: Teaches coding with interactive gameplay.

### **4. Reminder for Waste Collection**

#### **Tech Stack:**

- **Backend**: Node.js, MongoDB (store reminders), Nodemailer.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Collect Reminder Data:**

   - Allow users to set a date and time for reminders on the frontend.
   - Store this in MongoDB with their user ID.

2. **Send Reminder Notifications:**

   - Use **node-cron** to schedule reminders based on stored dates.
   - Use **Nodemailer** to send email notifications.

3. **Frontend Notification:**
   - Optionally, notify the user on the web app using browser notifications or alerts.

#### **Example Implementation:**

- **Todoist**: Sends reminders for tasks.
- **Google Calendar**: Lets users set notifications for events.

#### **Code Sample for Node-cron Reminder:**

```javascript
const cron = require("node-cron");
const nodemailer = require("nodemailer");

// Set up email transport
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: "Gmail",
  auth: {
    user: "your-email@gmail.com",
    pass: "your-email-password",
  },
});

// Schedule the reminder
cron.schedule("* * * * *", async () => {
  // Fetch reminders from the database
  const reminders = await getRemindersDueNow();

  reminders.forEach((reminder) => {
    const mailOptions = {
      from: "your-email@gmail.com",
      to: reminder.email,
      subject: "Waste Collection Reminder",
      text: `Hey ${reminder.name}, don't forget to collect your waste today!`,
    };
    transporter.sendMail(mailOptions);
  });
});
```

## **Suggestions for Interactive Learning**

1. **Gamified Sorting Game:**

   - Show bins (plastic, organic, etc.) and let users drag and drop items.
   - Use libraries like **React DnD** for drag-and-drop functionality.

2. **Image Identification:**

   - Show pictures of items and ask users to classify them (e.g., "Is this recyclable?").

3. **Scenario-Based Learning:**

   - Present real-world scenarios (e.g., "You have a pizza box. How do you dispose of it?").

4. **Progressive Challenges:**
   - Introduce levels where each level teaches more advanced sorting techniques.

#### **Examples:**

- **Recycle Coach**: Combines educational content with practical sorting tools.
- **Duolingo**: Gamifies learning with progressive challenges and rewards.
